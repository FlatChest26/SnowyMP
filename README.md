# Snowy MP

A small mod for GZDoom that adds some co-op mechanics to multiplayer to incentivize teamwork!

Features:
- Reviving downed players.
- Spectating others while waiting to be revived.
- Health bars on the HUD
- Customizable settings and rules.
- Silly COD Zombies game over MIDI's that play when each player is dead. (covered by me)

Snowy MP is a mod I created for personal use a few months ago to make experiencing new WAD's with my friends more enjoyable. The mechanics are somewhat inspired by Call of Duty Zombies and the Outlast Trials.
