# Snowy MP

A small mod for GZDoom that adds some co-op mechanics to multiplayer to incentivize teamwork!

Features:
- Reviving downed players.
- Spectating others while waiting to be revived.
- Health bars on the HUD
- Customizable settings and rules.
- Silly COD Zombies game over MIDI's that play when each player is dead. (MIDI covers by me)

Snowy MP is a mod I created to make experiencing new WAD's with my friends more enjoyable. The mechanics are somewhat inspired by Call of Duty Zombies and The Outlast Trials.

The mod's mechanics only work when in a network game!!!
